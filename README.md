ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kate Dao. I have 8 years of hospitality experience, having worked as a Hotel Sales Professional at Hyatt Vietnam and Hilton Toronto. Now, Iâ€™m eager to apply my analytics expertise and industry knowledge in a Business Analyst role, where I can help organizations make data-driven decisions and reach their goals. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Business or Data Analytics projects about hospitality, technology, biotechnology and healthcare. 

ðŸ“« I can be reached at: khanhphuc58@gmail.com 
 
âš¡ Fun fact: I practice Muay Thai.
